# [OG] - Write a JS test or a migration to reproduce the steps done on the interface

## Steps to reproduce

- Create MinnieGovernance
- => observe bank.contributorsCount == 0:
  - get bank proxy address from governance.proxyFor("bank")
  - get the bankProxy instance from this address
  - get the bank address from bankProxy.target
  - call bank.contributorsCount
- Create TestProposal(governance)
- Call governance.executeProposal(proposal)  // [FIXME] - here, we need to skip the
  isExecutableProposal call for now
- => observe it should have added a contributor in the bank.

# [TODO] - Write a test with Javascript for the gov -> bank setting
